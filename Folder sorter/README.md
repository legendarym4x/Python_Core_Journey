### Folder sorter

Many people have a folder on their desktop called something like "Disassemble". As a rule, hands never manage to 
disassemble this folder.

This program can sort such extension:

    Images ('JPEG', 'PNG', 'JPG', 'SVG')
    Video files ('AVI', 'MP4', 'MOV', 'MKV')
    Documents ('DOC', 'DOCX', 'TXT', 'PDF', 'XLSX', 'PPTX')
    Music ('MP3', 'OGG', 'WAV', 'AMR')
    Archives ('ZIP', 'GZ', 'TAR')
    Unknown extensions

The output of the script includes:

    A list of files in each category (music, video, photos, etc.)
    A list of all recognized script extensions found in the target folder.
    A list of all extensions that are unknown to the script.

Example of running a script:

    python clean.py C:\Users\Username\Desctop\Your_folder
