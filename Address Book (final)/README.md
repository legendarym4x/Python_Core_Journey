### In this homework:

We add the functionality of saving the address book to disk and restoring it from disk. To do this, we choose 
the `JSON` data serialization/deserialization protocol and implement methods that will save all data to a file and download it from a file.

We also add the ability for the user to search the contents of the contact book, so that all information about one or more users can 
be found by a few digits of the phone number or letters of the name, etc.
